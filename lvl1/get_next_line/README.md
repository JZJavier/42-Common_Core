## get_next_line

> _The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor._

  You will understand how files are opened, read and closed in an OS,
	and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.
	This task is crucial to understand for a future programmer since much of the time is based
	on manipulating files for data management and persistence.
	This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.
